# C Programming

 Here are my studies in C. One day I hope to be one of the greatest programmers in the C language. It is very academic, very sophisticated, and one must truly understand how the computer thinks to use it well.
 
 NOTA BENE:
 These applications all use the CS50 header, a header used to bypass CLANG and CHMOD.
