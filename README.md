# C Programming
 I love C programming. I think it is pure and reminds me of my studies is classical Greek and Latin.

 Here you will find my studies in C. One day I hope to be one of the greatest programmers in the C language. It is very academic, very sophisticated, and one must truly understand how the computer thinks to use it well.
